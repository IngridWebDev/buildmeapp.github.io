        <h2 id="first-post">We want it <em>NOW</em></h2>
        <h3>March 3, 2019 @ 11:21AM</h3>
        
        <p>Back when I was in high school (Btw, I am a 90’s kid), talking to friends or communication in general happens in person or over the phone. Now, with the rapid advancement of technology, it has changed the way our world operates. We no longer appreciate in person meetings or talks over phone. Most of time we communicate through texts, snapchats, messenger, and on any other social media channels. We are now living in a world where there is fast-paced and far-reaching alterations. What was cool just yesterday will no longer be a trend the next day and then we move onto the next big fad.</p>

<p>But take note: technology is not bad at all. There is absolutely nothing wrong with utilizing these technological innovations available in the market. In fact, these social media platforms or other means of communication has given people more leeway and comfort in their interpersonal interactions. Technology has also given people the opportunity to communicate with someone at the other side of the globe and expand their social networks. However, this has significantly made humans become hardwired to want things NOW --we very much want to experience pleasure or fulfillment without any delay or adjournment. </p> 

<p>Back then we were taught to wait patiently before getting what we need or want but because technology or, should I say, EVERYTHING is evolving faster than ever before, admit it or not, waiting has become harder because we have all the more developed an innate desire to have what we want, when we want it and when we don’t get it immediately, our psychological response is anxiety or tension.</p>

        <h2 id="second-post">Social Media has revolutionized marketing</h2>
        <h3>March 3, 2019 @ 11:21AM</h3>

        <p> In the past few years, social media’s power has increased remarkably, which has highly influenced and transformed the way businesses, big or small, communicate and engage with their customers and every day, more and more people are using the sites such as Facebook and Twitter to connect with their friends, families or colleagues in lieu of conventional means such as e-mail, phone call or even in-person meetings.</p>

<p>According to Statista, currently, there are 2.34 billion of social network users worldwide and it is expected to increase by 26% in 2020. This simply indicates that the number of active users on social media is growing and will certainly continue to grow. While Facebook remains as the popular social network site, which has 1.71 billion users all over the world, Twitter and Instagram are also rising in popularity, which have 313 and 500 million active users respectively. By now, it must be pretty obvious to everyone that social media is everywhere and it is here to stay.</p>

<p>Social media is so powerful that it has affected and revolutionized the way many areas of organizations perform today and one area which it has exceptionally created a massive impact on is marketing. Today, social media’s role in marketing efforts has become very significant, that it has become a requirement for digital marketing. It has given immense control and power to consumers. This means that individuals can talk about brands across different platforms, with or without the firm’s permission. Now, let us take a closer look at some of the perks of utilizing social media as part of an company’s marketing efforts.</p>

<p>Compared to the traditional media, wherein there is just one-way communication, social media is a platform that allows businesses to engage and interact with their customers. And guess what, it is cheaper. In fact, a lot cheaper. Using social media enables a company to reach a thousand people in just a fraction of the cost than it can through billboards, TV or even email. Also, social media brings in so much information about the target audience and gives companies a torrent of highly valuable customer feedback. It provides businesses with data-driven analytics such as who is viewing their content, what the customers’ opinions are about the product and use these to make data-driven decisions in order to be successful in the long run.</p>

<p id="quote">"Having all these in mind, it is crystal clear that companies need to stay on top of the social media game in order to increase customer engagement and brand awareness."</p>

<p>When utilized in an optimal manner, social media can be very lucrative, especially in the long term. However, there is so much more than meets the eye and that is why it is absolutely crucial for companies to have a well-articulated digital marketing strategy before wading into the social media waters.</p>
